# What Problem Does it Solve?
Purrfect Pair helps users to adopt pets in an efficient manner based on their preference and location. Purrfect Pair also helps to match people with a companion which aims to improve mental health and loneliness and promote animal adoption.

The adoption process in the past is users searching for various websites by searching different adoption locations while comparing how far it is themselves, and the information was scattered into various different adoption or shelter websites.

Our website shows all the pets that are available to adopt by letting adoption/shelter workers adding pets to our website and linking their adoption process. Before they are able to post pets, they go through a verification process to make sure there is no faux. So, for regular users, they have an easier access to adopt pets, and shelter/adoption workers donâ€™t need to update their website every so often, since a lot of them are already outdated.

# How were we inspired?
We were inspired to create a website which would help to promote animal adoption from pet shelters, as there are so many animals who need a forever home. In order to increase the percentage of animals which are adopted from shelters we wanted to make an accessible platform which would give pet owners the opportunity to see just how great these animals really are and to help give these animals a better chance at finding the owner they deserve. With the pandemic, the rate how pet ownership has skyrocketed over the past several months. Many people face loneliness and anxiety which can be cause by the often-isolating world we live in today. With our website we seek to be one source in which people can find a pet companion to help improve mental health and bring happiness into the lives of people and animals.

# How was it built?
Our website uses ReactJs for the frontend, Spring, MySQL, and Firebase for the database and authentication, as well as AdobeXD for the prototype. Given the time constraint and the fact that 3/4 of the hackers are first time hackers, we are very happy with the result so far! There are a number of features we plan to implement in the future such as the favourites page, greater filtering functionality, allowing shelters to register and upload pet information, booking times to visit the animal shelters, to name a few.
